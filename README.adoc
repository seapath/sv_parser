== Description

Tool to parse IEC 61850 Sampled Values from the packet payload.
The SV payload contains the following information:

| `noASDU`   | Number of ASDU in the sequence                     |
| `seqASDU`  | Sequence of ASDU                                   |

And or each ASDU contains the following information:

| Champ          | Description                                                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `svID`         | User-defined unique string identifier used for subscription                        |
| `datSet`       | The name of the data set being sent                                                |
| `smpCnt`       | Index of the SV message                                                            |
| `confRev`      | Configuration revision                                                             |
| `smpSynch`     | Synchronization mechanism of the clock used for sending the SV                     |
| `smpMod`       | Sample Mode : samples/period, samples/sec, sec/sample                              |
| `smpRate`      | Sample rate                                                                        |
| `refrTm`       | Time of the first sample                                                           |
| `seqDataLength`| Length of the sequence of data                                                     |
| `seqData`      | Sequence of measured voltage and current values                                    |

== How to use

The structure containing parser information can be managed using constructors and destructors.
All you need to do is call parser `parse_SV_payload`, providing it with the SV network packet payload, and the previously created structure.
